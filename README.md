# Cat Image Classification Neural Network

A from scratch neural network for classifying cat images using deep learning.

## Introduction

This project is a  example of building a neural network to classify cat images. The neural network is trained on a dataset of labeled cat and non-cat images.

## Features

- Image classification as "cat" or "not cat."
- Pre-trained model for quick inference.
- Training scripts for custom dataset.
